# Rob
As we all know the Prowlbox is not going to be installed in the same venue, for example a country nightclub, wouldn't want the information of it's patrons playlists that had EDM data on their or vice versa. 

Rob is going to possibly solve this by using the Gracenote API. So we can identify songs being played in a venue, to target what songs on a patron's Spotify's playlist. 

This will be written in Python (potentially C++) by Montana Mendy and Edin Beteivaz.
